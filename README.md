# Basic-Queue-using-templates-and-execptions
A simple class template for a queue class.

PROBLEM
A queue must keep track of two indexes to an array: one to the tail, where new items are added, and one to the head, where old items are removed. The tail follows the head through the array as items are added and removed. If either the tail or the head reaches the end of the array, it is reset to the beginning.
